# GSAFuzz
GSA-Fuzz is a AFL-based fuzzer that utilizes Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) to find the optimal selection probability distribution of mutation operators and mutation positions. 
# Usage
The Usage of GSA-Fuzz is the same as AFL's.
# Others
the afl-fuzz.c will put in the res in near future,if you use GSA-Fuzz, please kindly help to cite our paper:
